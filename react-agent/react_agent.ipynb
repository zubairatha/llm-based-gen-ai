        "# ReAct Agent with Multiple Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent as described by Yao et al. [1], incorporating three main tools: search, compare, and analyze. The agent handles complex queries by reasoning about which tool to use and when.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Search Tool**: Uses SerpAPI to search the web and format results for the ReAct agent\n",
        "2. **Compare Tool**: A custom LangChain tool that compares multiple items along a category\n",
        "3. **Analyze Tool**: Summarizes and extracts key information from search results or comparisons\n",
        "4. **ReAct Agent Integration**: Uses LangChain's `initialize_agent` with `AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` to orchestrate the tools\n",
        "5. **Streamlit UI**: A user interface for interacting with the agent\n",
